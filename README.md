# Sandbox-Repository

This is my sandbox repository where I test stuff. Don't expect this to make any sense.

## python stuff

To install dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt `

To run the python tests:
`coverage run -m unittest discover`

To view coverage report:
`coverage report -m`

To generate HTML coverage report:
`coverage html`

To generate JSON coverage report:
`coverage json -q -o /dev/stdout`
